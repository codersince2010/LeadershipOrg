Introduction to Decision-Making

and Decision-Making Biases Part 1





What is decision-making?

• The process of choosing a course of action for

dealing with a problem or opportunity.

• Decision making is the one truly distinctive

characteristic of managers.

• Some things we’re quite good at…





Unidimensional vs.

Multidimensional

Tastiest?

Tasty, healthy, and cheap?





Immediate vs. Extended Threat

Immediate

Extended





Limited choices vs. Lots of choices

Limited

Lots of choices





**Some Decision Biases…**

• **Confirmation error** – only seeking cues in a

situation that support a preexisting opinion.

• **Hindsight error** – overestimate the degree to

which an event that has already taken place

could have been predicted.

• **Framing error** - tendency to evaluate and

resolve a problem in the context in which it is

perceived – either positive or negative.





**Framing Effects**





Framing effects

• Example

• 93% of students registered early when a penalty fee for

late registration was emphasized

• 67% doing so when this was presented as a discount for

earlier registration.

• \*susceptibility to framing effects increases with age





**600 people affected by a deadly**

**disease**

72% favored A

Treatment A

Treatment B

"A 33% chance of

saving all 600 people,

66% possibility of

saving no one.”

"Saves 200 lives"





**600 people affected by a deadly**

**disease**

22% favored A

Treatment A

Treatment B

"A 33% chance that

no people will die,

66% probability that

all 600 will die."

"400 people will die"





RICIE Model





What is involved in the decision-

making process?

• **Steps in Decision Making**

• **Recognize** and define the problem

• **Identify** and analyze alternative courses of action.

• **Choose** a preferred course of action

• **Implement** the preferred course of action

• **Evaluate** the results and follow-up as necessary.





Recognize the Problem

• The problem is the discrepancy between an existing

state and a desired state

• Where managers screw up

• Identify problems that don’t exert pressure to act

• Millennials are lazy

• It’s a down economy

• Fail to characterize a situation as problematic unless they

have the resources necessary to act

• Too broad or too narrow

• Identify symptoms as problems





Symptoms versus Problems

**Symptoms**

**Underlying Problems**

Low profits/declining sales

High cost

Poor market research

Poor design process, poorly

trained employees

Low morale

Lack of communication between

management and subordinates

High employee turnover

High rate of absenteeism

Rate of pay too low, job design

not suitable

Employees believe that they are

not valued





Identify Alternatives

• Where managers go wrong

• Failing to identify what is relevant

• Failing to consult key stakeholders

• Not seeking out information

• How many restaurants would never open if they had done some

basic market research?

• How much money could people save on home repair if they got 3

estimates?

• Stopping once the first viable alternative is proposed





Choose a Course of Action

• A manager needs to evaluate each alternative in

terms of-

• Feasibility (can it be done?)

• Effectiveness (how well does it resolve the problem?)

• Consequences (what will be its cost to the organization?)

• Where managers go wrong

• Failing to consider time, cost, impact, and ethics

• The wrong person makes the decision

• Sometimes you have to decide, sometimes you need to delegate

and approve





Implement a Course of Action

• Where managers go wrong

• Fail to secure buy-in from stakeholders

• Determine how actions will be monitored.

• Evaluation system should provide feedback on how well

the decisions are being implemented

• What are the results? How will we measure?

• What adjustments are necessary to get the results?





Evaluate Results

• Where managers go wrong (everywhere)

• Fail to operationalize performance beforehand

• Fail to measure during

• Fail to follow up afterward

• Fail to learn from prior decision-making instances





Decision-Making Biases Part 2





Availability bias

• Relying too much on

information that is easy to

recall from memory

• Overweight recent trends

and salient moments

• Investors who check their

stocks daily perform worse

than those that check less

frequently

• Game changers and

wunderkind





Survivor bias

• Tendency to focus on the

people or things that have

passed some kind of

selection process





Anchoring bias

• Overreliance on first piece

of information—even when

it's completely irrelevant.





Representativeness bias

• Tendency to make

decisions based on how

similar something is to a

preconceived category

• Stereotyping





Overconfidence (Dunning-Kruger

Effect)

Less than 5% of MBA students expect their

performance to be below the median in most

classes

94% of

professors at a

large university

believed they

were better than

the average

professor

Small business owners estimate the

success rate for most small businesses

at 50%, but the success rate for their

own business at 90%

**Individual vs Group Decisions**





Individual and Group Decisions





Unilateral

• Leader makes the decision with no input from team

• When to use it?

• Frequently made decisions

• Need fast decision

• Leader is expert in area

• Low risk decision

• Pro: Quick

• Con: No input from others





Consultative

• Leader gathers input and makes executive decision

after hearing from team

• When to use it?

• Leader doesn’t have expertise in area

• Pro: Leader gains insight from consultation

• Con: Takes time

• Con: Also, what if your conclusion differs from teams

(justice perception issue)?





Consensus

• Majority decision

• When to use

• Medium to high-risk decision

• Significant buy-in is needed

• Pro: All team members take part in decision

• Con: Agreement is limited to the majority, not the

whole

• Con: Opportunity for naysaying cliques to develop





Team Agreement

• Unanimous decision

• When to use:

• Need total buy-in

• Need to portray solidarity

• High-risk decision

• Pro: team is on record of supporting decision

• Anything TMT related benefits from this

• Con: Takes a long time

• Con: A single holdout can gain significant

concessions from the group





Expert

• Single person with expertise makes the call

• When to use

• Clear that leader/team lacks expertise (think accountant)

• His/her expertise acknowledged by the team

• Cost is justified

• Expertise/impartiality is verifiable

• Pro: Most capable person makes the decision

• Pro: Quicker than training the up team or a team member

• Con: Sometimes difficult to determine who’s an expert

(easier with hard skills; more difficult with soft skills)

• Con: Vested interests may not be apparent





Subgroup

• Subset of team makes the decision (representative

democracy)

• When to use

• Interest is not universal

• Expertise rests with a small group

• Time is limited

• Team as a whole buys-in to outsourcing

• Pro: Quicker than team agreement and maybe even

consensus

• Pro: The most informed make the decision

• Con: May lose commitment in larger group

• Con: Greater chance for 1 member domineering





**Vroom-**

**Jago**

**Decision**

**-Making**

**Model**





Vroom et al. Definitions…

• **Authority decisions:**

• A1: manager makes the decision alone.

• A2: manager obtains information from team members then makes the decision

alone.

• **Consultative decisions:**

• C1: manager shares the problem with team members individually without bringing

them all together. Based on their feedback, manager makes the decision alone.

• C2: manager shares the problem with team members collectively, then manager

then makes a decision alone.

• **Team decisions**:

• G: manager shares the problem with team members as a total group and engages

them in consensus seeking to arrive at a final decision.





Nominal Group Technique





Nominal group technique

• Relatively quick method of getting to a majority

decision (consensus) while incorporating all

perspectives

• Even when some members don’t get their preferred

way, buy-in can still be high

• Far, far better than unstructured brainstorming





Nominal group technique steps

\1. Everyone writes down their solution with a brief

justification

• Means we need consensus on the problem

• Doesn’t allow for the talkers to dominate

\2. All solutions are tallied and similar/same solutions

are bundled

\3. Leader facilitates discussion

• Trying to identify commonalities

• Potential unintended consequences

• Can lead to hybrid ideas





Nominal group technique steps (cont.)

\4. Members then rank-order their preferences

• Depending on group size/number of solutions proffered,

you may want to limit (e.g., top 5 solutions)

\5. Highest tally wins

• Reverse scoring (e.g., First choice = 5 points, fifth choice =

1 point)





When to use

• Some team members tend to dominate conversation

• Concern that participation is low

• New teams or new team members

• High risk/high stakes decision

• Debate will likely be heated

• Power imbalances

• When problems are ill-structured





Ill-Structured problems

• Process begins the same way, but facilitator takes on

additional role of questioning if the ideas are relevant

to the same problem

• If not, then the solutions are clustered into different

groups

• Clusters of ill-structured ideas are then treated as

problems and the NGT is applied to these





Team Effectiveness





What are teams and why do they

matter?

• Teams are interdependent groups of two or more

people who:

• See themselves as an identifiable group

• Are interdependent (work together to complete tasks)

• Are responsible for collective outcomes

• Organizations use teams more than ever –

knowledge work; whole greater than the parts

• People tend to define themselves in terms of their

group membership





Assets and Liabilities of Teams

¢ LIABILITIES

¢ ASSETS

l Perform worse than

the most competent

team member

l Perform better than the

average team member

on complex tasks

working alone on

simpler tasks

l Synergy

l Divergent ideas

l Creativity

l Social loafing, free

riders, apathy

l Use more information

l Shared responsibility

l Time

l Groupthink

l Diffused responsibility

**Teams are most beneficial if the work is complex & creative!**





Effective teams…

• Know why the group exists and have shared goals

Communicate freely amongst themselves

• Believe that they can accomplish their tasks

(potency)

• Like and help one another (cohesion)

• Maximize process gains, minimize process loss





Process Gains and Losses

**Process Gains include:**

o Sharing of information to build a positive spiral of ideas

(synergy).

o Motivational gains (particularly for low ability members)

**Process Losses include:**

o Groupthink: When people disagree with a solution, but

are hesitant to voice their concerns

o Social Loafing: Members put in less effort than if working

alone





Process Loss: Social Loafing

• When individuals do not do their fair share of the

work

• Diffusion of responsibility





Process Loss: Groupthink

• “When a group makes faulty decisions because

group pressures lead to a deterioration of mental

efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment” –Janis

(1972)





Process Loss: Groupthink

**SYMPTOMS**

\1. Illusion of invulnerability –excessive optimism

\2. Collective rationalization – Members discount warnings and do not

reconsider their assumptions.

\3. Belief in inherent morality – Members ignore the ethical or moral

consequences of their decisions.

\4. Stereotyped views of out-groups – Others are the “enemy”

\5. Direct pressure on dissenters – Members are under pressure not to

express arguments against any of the group’s views.

\6. Self-censorship – Doubts are not expressed.

\7. Illusion of unanimity – The majority view are assumed to be unanimous.

\8. Self-appointed ‘mindguards’ – Members protect the group and the leader

from information that is problematic or contradictory.





Process Loss: Groupthink





To Avoid Process Losses

• To avoid**social loafing** • To avoid**groupthink**

• Make individual

contributions identifiable

(small size).

• Appoint devil’s advocate or

critical evaluator.

• Bring in outside experts &

LISTEN

• Use positive reinforcement.

• Assign people to job/tasks

that are intrinsically

interesting.

• Brainstorm individually

before and after, use group

brainstorming in the middle.

• Provide accurate, timely

feedback.

• Use brainstorming to

integrate and combine

ideas, not just generate.

*"Brainstorming Works Best if People Scramble For Ideas on Their Own,“ WSJ*





Team Composition





Team Composition

• Part of the “inputs” that predict team effectiveness

• More complicated than individual-level

• Have to consider other individuals – similarity vs.

difference

• Deep vs. surface-level diversity

• Deep is unobservable, more important over time

• Surface is observable, more important early on





Social Identity Theory

• Groups give us a sense of social identity: a sense of

belonging to the social world.

• **Categorization:** we sort people (including ourselves) to

understand the social environment

• **Identification:** we adopt the identity of the group we have

categorized ourselves as belonging to

• **Comparison:** we then tend to compare that group with

other groups

• In work teams, who the relevant “group” actually is

changes over time





Diversity and Tenure

• Functional Diversity:

• Higher is better, but only if relevant to task.

• Demographic Diversity (age, gender, race):

• Better for creativity, but slow cohesion, less satisfied, & higher turnover.

• Tenure

• Better for individual members to have high tenure with the job

• Diversity of individual tenure is good, but effects are small





Intelligence Personality

• Intelligence

• Higher is better.

**CON**

• Personality:

**AGR**

**ES**

• Moderate or mixed

levels of EXT; high

levels of CON, AGR\*,

& ES

• For AGR & ES, 1 low

member can spoil the

team

**Extraversion**





Conflict

**Peace is not the absence of conflict, it is the ability to**

**handle conflict by peaceful means.**

**–Ronald Reagan**





Conflict in Organizations

• Conflicts occur whenever disagreements exist in a social

setting or when emotional antagonisms create friction

between individuals or groups.

• **Task conflict**

• A fundamental disagreement over ends or goals to be

pursued, and the means for their accomplishment.

• **Relationship conflict**

• Interpersonal difficulties that arise over feelings of anger,

mistrust, dislike, fear, resentment, and the like.





Effects of Conflict





Benefits of Conflict

• Brings important problems to the surface so they

can be addressed.

• Causes decisions to be carefully considered.

• Increases amount of information used for

decision making.

• Provides opportunities for creativity.





Costs of Conflict

• Diverts energies.

• Hurts group cohesion;

• Promotes interpersonal hostilities.

• Creates a negative environment.

• Can decrease performance and job satisfaction.

• Can contribute to lower commitment.

Closing Thoughts on Decision-

Making





People are vulnerable to biases and

errors

• Avoid them yourself

• Know the biases

• System 1 vs. System 2 thinking

• Utilize the RICIE/Nominal group techniques

• When needed – use outside experts

• Avoid relational conflict

• Use them to your advantage

• Frame decisions as:

• Immediate, unidimensional, action/inaction as a loss

• Seek task conflict

• Obsess over implementation





Peter Drucker

• “Good people work for two years to develop a new

policy. It's unveiled with great fanfare in a big meeting

with overhead projectors, PowerPoint slides, and

what have you. The big boss appears and blesses it.

“It has my full support,” he solemnly says. Everybody

gets a policy memorandum…and that’s the last we

hear about it.”





Converting a Decision to Action

• Hope versus plan of action

• Until this has been broken into actionable steps, assigned

to people who are responsible for getting their step done,

and a deadline imposed, then it’s a hope for change, not a

plan of action

• Managers, consultants, and teams are really good at

hope, but they’re lousy at plans of action





Converting a Decision to Action

• If you’re asking people to change their behaviors or

attitudes, you need to align this with HR policy

• Do you need to adjust your performance evaluation

procedures?

• Do you need to incorporate this into selection?

• Did this decision affect turnover and was this necessarily a

bad thing (exit interviews)?





Altering the plan

• Be open to feedback and adjustments, but trust your

decision

• “No battle plan survives first contact with the enemy” -Von

Moltke the Elder

• “The deployment of millions cannot be improvised.” -Von

Moltke the Younger

• Remember the law of small numbers

• Early failures are not reason enough to scrap/significantly

adjust plan of action



**Introduction to Motivation**





Why are we talking about motivation?

• Predicts performance and commitment

• P = f(M x A)

• Importance of managers being able to disentangle

cause of low performance





What is Motivation?

• Forces within and outside the individual that account

for the direction, level, and persistence of a person’s

effort expended at work.

• **Direction** - an individual’s choice when presented

with a number of possible alternatives.

• **Intensity** - the amount of effort a person puts forth.

• **Persistence** - the length of time a person sticks with

a given action.





Employee engagement

• What is an “engaged” employee?

• High intensity and persistence

• Gallup survey – only 30% of employees are engaged





Components of Motivation

Energizes Behavior

Drives

Compulsions

Deprivation/

Disequilibrium

Directs Behavior

Goals

Organization of Effort

Reaching Equilibrium

Sustains Behavior

Persistence

Ability to change course

Importance of Feedback





Needs Theories of Motivation





Self-Determination Theory

• All people need:

• Autonomy/Control

• Competence/Mastery

• Relatedness

• When you have all three, have higher perceptions of

meaningfulness

• Manager’s goal: fulfill these needs to fuel intrinsic

motivation





Empirical Evidence

• Some evidence suggests pay can demotivate

because it hurts perceptions of these needs

• Caveat: mostly experimental and with college students

• Satisfying these needs is part of the job

characteristics model

• Evidence is generally supportive

• Positive relationships between need fulfillment and

performance and commitment





Acquired Needs Theory

• People have varying levels of:

• **Need for achievement (nAch)**

• The desire to do something better or more efficiently, to solve

problems, or to master complex tasks.

• **Need for affiliation (nAff)**

• The desire to establish and maintain friendly and warm relations

with others.

• **Need for power (nPower)**

• The desire to control others, to influence their behavior, or to be

responsible for others.





Thematic Apperception Test (T.A.T.)





Empirical Evidence

• ENTs are higher than managers on N-ach

• N-ach is associated with venture creation and

venture success (r = .22 & .30, respectively)

• Younger generations have higher need for affiliation

and need for achievement, but lower need for power

• Need for power among women is a good predictor of

seeking out and attaining jobs that offer authority

• Toxic combination of high power, low affiliation and

low achievement





Expectancy Theory





Expectancy Theory

• Motivation is a multiplicative function of expectancy,

instrumentality, and valance (M = E x I x V)

• Expectancy

• effort will yield acceptable performance

• Instrumentality

• performance will be rewarded

• Valence

• value of the rewards is highly positive





Expectancy Theory





Self-efficacy

• Self-efficacy is the belief that you have the capability

to execute behaviors necessary for success on the

job

• Critical antecedent to expectancy

• Managers can help build self-efficacy by:

• Selection

• Assigning employees to tasks that are similar to tasks they

have succeeded in the past

• Linking employees with others who have succeeded in

similar roles

• Persuading employees they can “get the job done”

• Help manage anxiety or fear over new job tasks





Equity Theory





Equity Theory

• People are motivated to behave in ways that restore

or maintain equity

• Foundation of equity is social comparison





Equity Theory

Individual Outcomes

Individual Inputs

Others’ Outcomes

Others’ Inputs

= or ≠





Grapes and Cucumbers





Reactions to Inequity

• Behavioral

• Change inputs (e.g., work less in case of underpayment; work

more in case of overpayment)

• Change outcomes (e.g., ask for a raise in pay; work through

paid vacation)

• Leave the situation

• Stealing/sabotage comparison point

• Psychological

• Change the comparison point (e.g., compare to a different

colleague)

• Distort things (e.g., rationalize that the comparison worker is

more deserving; rationalize that you are more deserving)

• Loafing





Distribute + Procedural Justice





Goal Setting Theory





Goal Setting Theory

• The process of developing, negotiating, and

formalizing the targets or objectives that a person is

responsible for accomplishing.

• Draw attention to discrepancy between current and

desired state

• I have to sell $100,000 this month but I’ve only sold

$10,000





Goal Setting Theory

• Goals are more effective when they are:

• Specific

• Much better than vague: “I want to sell a lot” vs “I want to sell

$10,000”

• Measureable

• Aids in feedback

• Attainable

• Difficult goals are motivating, but not too difficult!

• Relevant

• Employee wants to hit this goal

• Timebound

• Keep relatively short time frames in the context of longer time

frames





Extrinsic Reward is Not Required





How to use GST

• Provide task feedback

• Draws attention to discrepancy – key to GST

• Increase self-efficacy

• Confidence makes goal setting more effective

• Stimulate goal commitment and acceptance

• Do not assign goals, but involve employees

• Management by Objectives (MBO)

• Process of joint goal setting and feedback between a

supervisor and a subordinate.





Complications in Goal Setting

• Any part “missing”, they don’t work

• Early stages of learning a complex task

• Have to have clearly defined performance

•**Unintended consequences**

Unintended consequences of GST

• Goals focus attention and we have limited amounts

of attention

• Goals are the ends and the means often get ignored

• Larrick et al. (2009) demonstrated that people motivated

by specific, challenging goals adopt riskier strategies and

choose riskier gambles

• To companies, goals are like Lay’s potato chips

• Landis (1992) gave participants both quality goals and

quantity goals. When quantity and quality goals were both

difficult, participants sacrificed quality to meet the quantity

goals





Why all the GST hate?

• Goals inhibit learning (Cervone, Jiwani, & Wood, 1991)

• Goals create a culture of competition that reduces

OCB (Wright, George, Farnsworth, & McMahan, 1993)

• Goals encourage myopia among CEOs creating

agency problems and moral hazard (Cheng, Subramanyam,

and Zhang, 2005)

• Met goals are extrinsically rewarded and thereby

reduce intrinsic rewards (Mossholder, 1980)





Compensation





Compensation

• Balance of:

• Strategic concerns

• Equity/fairness concerns

• Motivation concerns

• Want to:

• Motivate good employees to perform better and stay

• Motivate bad employees to improve or leave





Compensation System Considerations

• Base pay and salary bands

• Choices of whether to lead, meet, or lag market





Compensation System Considerations

• Salary bands





Compensation System Considerations

• Pay-for-performance…

• Works (see expectancy/equity/goal-setting theories)! But

with some caveats

• Different flavors

• Merit raises

• Lump sum bonuses

• Commission\*

• Piece-rate\*

• Employee stock options (ESOP)





Compensation System Considerations

• Group incentives

• Help solve issues of potential competition/misaligned

objectives with individual-based pay

• Different flavors

• Profit-sharing

• Use of pay-for-performance, but with the group (e.g., entire

team gets a bonus)





Module Key Takeaways





Module Key Takeaways

• Motivation is the direction, intensity, and persistence

of effort

• Needs-based theories focus on satisfying individual

needs for motivation

• Expectancy, equity, and goal-setting theories focus

on situational characteristics that impact motivation

• Beware the potential negative consequences of goal

setting

• When it comes to pay, link to performance

\1) the achievement of the unit’s goals,

\2) the continued commitment of the

unit’s employees, and

\3) the development of mutual trust,

**CREDIBILITY**

**TRUST**

**COMMUNITY**





Personal leadership





Personal leadership

• Develop and exhibit an authentic personal

leadership style based on your own values and

personality.

• Create and convey strategic insight and vision.

• Demonstrate courage and passion about what you

do.





Understanding your values

• What is your core ideology?

• You want to lead…but where…and how?

• First, you must “lead yourself”

• Think carefully about what your values are.

• Understand what trade-offs you are willing to make.

• Understand your values form the basis for your leadership style





Developing your vision

What is your envisioned future?

How will you leverage your core ideology to creatively develop your vision?

• Think hard and deep about what you want to accomplish… Develop your

personal expertise… Demonstrate competence… Be smart.

• Take the time to look as far into the future as you can… Clarify opportunities

and threats… Be wise.

• Look for new solutions and new approaches… To lead you must go first…Be

creative.

• Draw on your personal passion for your vision… Be enthusiastic.





Courage: a key to personal leadership

• Courage — placing oneself at risk as much as, or even

more than, you are asking others to do — is one of

the most effective ways to communicate your values,

vision, and style.

Courage tests you as a leader.





Effective personal

leadership yields

**CREDIBILITY**





Relational leadership





Relational leadership





Relational leadership

• Foster interpersonal emotional connection.

• Show concern, understanding, and respect for

others.

• Be seen as fair.



Leaders and followers: a relationship

• You should seek to form apersonal connection with each person you

“lead” (direct reports, peers, and superiors).

• In small groups, this poses a task, but not a problem. You must

put in the time and devote enough attention to make an

impression, to create a link.

• What can you do? Relational listening

• For large groups, this raises the challenge of building a virtual

personal relationship.

• What can you do? Story telling





Follower’s dilemma

• The “follower’s dilemma” is:

“How do we know he/she will lead us where ~~we~~ want to go,

not just where ~~he/she~~ wants to go?”

Personal leadership:

• **Dedication**

Relational leadership:

• **Concern, respect,** and **fairness**.





Relational listening

\1.

\2.

Seek the other person’s views.

Show you are understanding (and check your understanding) by

paraphrasing what the other told you and asking if there is more.

\3.

\4.

Show that you recognize the importance of the other’s views by

validating the other’s reactions within his or her understanding of

things. Agreement is not necessary!

Show that you are concerned with the other person’s welfare by

empathizing.

A Potential Fifth Step…

If the issue involves a problem with the leader, a fifth step might be either to

promise action or to explain why action will not take place. Only at this point

do you bring your own views into play.





Relational leadership and story-telling

• People remember stories more than facts.

• Statistics – 5 - 10% retention

• Statistics and story – 25 – 30% retention

• Story – 65 – 75% retention

• Stories not only capture emotion, but they can convey your

emotional connection (which is critical to relational leadership)





Fairness

• Fairness is more than just fair pay (distributive justice), it is:

• Treating people with dignity

• Playing by the rules; especially as they apply to you

• Giving people a chance to express their views, even if they run counter to

your own

• Showing that you consider what you hear

• Taking the time and effort to explain why things are happening in a

particular way

• Generally, fairness is showing people that you will make every effort to treat

them decently

Think about procedural justice!!!





Effective relational leadership

**TRUST**





Contextual leadership





Contextual leadership





Contextual leadership

• Create a sense of identity (pride and belonging)

• Focus and simplify to build a sense of coherence

• Enhance coordination through clarity of roles and

functions. Remember coordination loss!





Contextual leadership

• The job of a contextual leader is to help follower

sense-making

• who we are

• why we do things the way we do

• how all the pieces fit together – including where

I fit and where others fit





Effective contextual

leadership yields

**COMMUNITY**





Inspirational leadership





Inspirational leadership





Inspirational leadership

• Create a climate of excellence

• Encourage innovation

• Raise enthusiasm and optimism





Inspirational leadership rests on a foundation of

personal and relational leadership

**Why?**





Inspiring the will to achieve

• Inspiration comes from a sense of personal value

• Make people believe and feel that they are respected and are

worthy of that respect.

• Make people see and feel that their work and

efforts are important.

• Convey the value of striving to achieve

• Highlight the urgency of the overall effort.

• Demand persistence and creativity in achieving

the difficult.

• Do not accept less than the best from each person.





Encourage innovation

• Separate idea generation from idea evaluation

• Institute a three-stage process:

• Guided Research: include research that questions standard

operating assumptions

• Idea generation: make space for “crazy” ideas (individual task)

• Idea evaluation: considered evaluation, with an eye to new

solutions (group task)





Raise enthusiasm

• Engender enthusiasm for tasks and goals

• Recall the importance of BHAG’s.

• Convey a sense of urgency.

• Promote a “can do” attitude.

succeed.





Effective inspirational

leadership yields





Supportive leadership





Supportive leadership





Supportive leadership

• Foster a sense of individual and team “efficacy”

• Promote accountability, but avoid blaming

• Protect your team





Supportive leadership rests on a

foundation of relational and contextual leadership.

**Why?**





Building efficacy

successes, even in the context of failure.

• Encourage mentoring and role-modeling.

• Encourage and reward your most competent and successful

people for sharing their skills and knowledge.

can’t.

• Knowing limits also helps us know how to succeed





Effective supportive leadership

yields





Responsible leadership





Responsible leadership





Responsible leadership

• Encourage integrative and balanced action.

• Model ethical behavior.

• Foster feelings of responsibility to others inside

and outside the firm.



Ethical responsibilities of leadership

As a leader, you have theresponsibility to consider

whether what you ask people to do is ethically correct.

• Ground your leadership direction in values:

• Your own,

• Your people’s,

• And also broader ethical principles.

• Actively confront the consequences:

• Of your actions and your organization’s actions toward all

stakeholders; and

• Accept responsibility for the consequences

• Personally set the standard





An ethical tool

• Do your actions and decisions meet the tests of:

• Dignity – Are you treating people with the dignity

everyone is entitled to?

• Benevolence – Are you doing more good than harm?

• Equity – Are you focusing your consideration only on the

powerful?





Stewardship

• A steward is a caretaker

• Protects organization and the community(s) in which it resides

• Accepts personal responsibility and fosters same feelings in others

• A steward is a role model

• Ethical example

• Balances the long-term best interests of the organization and its

stakeholders ahead of self-interest

• A steward is a motivator

• Motivates individuals to work for the greater good

**Stewardship is about your Legacy**





Effective responsible leadership fosters





Dark Side of Leadership





Dark Side of Leadership

• A lot of names for essentially

the same thing

• Abusive supervision

• Toxic leadership

• Destructive leadership

• Expose you to some of the

research and theory of bad

leadership





Abusive supervision

• “subordinates' perceptions of the extent to which supervisors engage

in the sustained display of hostile verbal and nonverbal behaviors,

excluding physical contact” (Tepper, 2000)

• Affects 13.6% of United States (US) workers, resulting in an estimated

US $23 billion cost to business





Abusive supervision

• derogatory names

• intimidation

• threats of job loss

• explosive and angry outbursts

• withholding necessary information

• taking credit for a subordinate’s success

• humiliating or ridiculing a subordinate in front of others





Effects on employees

• Attitudes toward boss (r = -.57)

• There is no grudging respect

• Job satisfaction (r = -.34)

• They hate their job

• Turnover intention (r = .31)

• They’re trying to leave

• CWB (r = .38)

• But, first they’re going to steal and break a bunch of stuff





Why are bad bosses bad?

• Person approach: Dark Triad, lack moral compass

• Personality clashes

• Systems approach: lack of oversight, period of rapid change





Contingency approach to toxic leadership





\1. Destructive leadership

• Charisma

• Outgoing, engaging, socially adept

• Need for power

• Ambitious, focused, energetic

• Narcissism

• Inflated view of self, ignore/discount negative feedback





\1. Destructive leadership

• Negative life themes

• Significant challenges or traumas in formative years

• Weaves a narrative of overcoming hardships

• Ideology of hate

• Rally support against a real or perceived threat

• Creates/exaggerates the threat to justify power

• Godwin’s Law: "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability

of a comparison involving Hitler approaches 1.”





\2. Susceptible followers

• **~~Conformers~~** passively permit

• Unmet needs

• Poor self-evaluation

• Immaturity

• **~~Colluders~~** actively assist

• Personal ambitions

• Perceived threat

• Internal or external

• Absence of checks and balances

• Emerging organization

• Poor institutional oversight





Power





Definitions

• **Power**

• The ability to get someone to do something you want done.

• The ability to make things happen in the way you want.

• **Social Power**

• The ability to influence another in a social relation.

• Earned through our relationships with others

• **Dependency**

• One person or group relies on another person or group to get

what they want or need.





Fixed versus expanding pie perspectives

• **Zero Sum Game** – one person’s gain is equal to another person’s loss

(“I win, you lose”).

• **Empowerment** – involves sharing power, information, and rewards

with employees to make decisions and solve problems in their work.





Two primary sources of power

•**Position**

• Derives from a person’s position in the organization

•**Personal**

• Resides in the individual

• Portable

• Independent of that individual’s position





Possibly a 3rd source of power

• **Reciprocal Alliances**

• Represents the power

arising from alliances

with others developed

through reciprocity (the

trade of power or

favors for mutual gain).

• Can work well when

you have equals with

differing skills and

resources





Bases of Power





**Legitimate**

**Reward**

**Coercive Information**

**Expert**

**Connection Referent**





Persuasion Tactics

The illusion of rationality





Following Social Norms

• We are social animals

• “When people are free to do as they please, they usually imitate each other.”

-Eric Hoffer

• People tend to look to others, especially a majority of others, to

decide how to behave in and perceive situations

• Any messages that show that many (or most) others are doing or

perceiving a certain way will influence one’s actions, choices and

perceptions





Following Social Norms

• An infomercial copywriter (Colleen Szot) changed the “call to action”

from:

• “Operators are standing by; please call now.”; to

• “If operators are busy, please call again.”

• Sales increased significantly; shattering a 20-year sales record.





Following norms

• When a message was left saying

it was good for the environment

to re-use towels, a certain

percentage of people re-used

(~7%)

• When the message was changed

to suggest that most people re-

used towels in that hotel, re-use

went up 26%; when it was more

specific (most people who stayed

in that particular room re-used)

re-use increased 33%





Takeaway

• Frame the message as “everyone else is doing it”

• Be careful

• Women’s Voices, during the 2004 presidential campaign, sent out 1 million

postcards with this message: “Four years ago, 22 million single women did

not vote.”

• Result?

Households who had had **above**

**average usage reduced their**

**consumption by 5.7**%;

**Those whose usage was below**

**average increased their**

**consumption by 8.6%**





What is social mimicry?

• Motor mimicry

• Facial mimicry

• Emotional contagion

• Reciprocal altruism

• Want people to complete your survey? Mail them a dollar





Social mimicry

• Increase people’s willingness to engage in helping

behavior if you closely follow their communication style





Social mimicry

• You probably already mirror people naturally, but you might be able

to improve your skill at gaining rapport if you attend to people more

closely. Listen to and watch them as they speak and interact with you.





Recency Bias

• Whatever the most recent or last part of an experience is tends to

color and strongly influence our overall memory or sense of that

experience.

**Excerpted from: Baldwin, T., Bommer, W &amp; Rubin R. (2012).** _ **Managing Organizational Behavior: What Great Managers Know &amp; Do** _ **.**

**New York: McGraw-Hill.**

**High-Performing Teams**

**The High-Performance Team Scorecard**

The scorecard for determining whether a team is high performing consists of three dimensions:
# 1

**Production Output.** The products or outcomes of the team meet or exceed the standards set in that context. For example, a manufacturing team that exceeds its quota would get high ratings.

**Member Satisfaction.** Being part of the team provides people with satisfaction. Members find belonging to the team to be a good experience both professionally and personally.

**Capacity for Continued Cooperation.** The team accomplishes its tasks in a way that will maintain or enhance its ability to work together in the future. That is, effective teams do not exhaust all their resources and goodwill, but get better at working together for the next project and continually strive to learn from mistakes.

A high-performance team, then, is one that produces high-quality work but also has members who derive value from being part of the group and who are able to learn from each project in ways that make them able to cooperate even better in the future. Any team can stumble on to some success. Great teams, however, strive to understand the reasons behind their performance so they are able to consistently repeat that success.

**The Five Disciplines of High-Performing Teams**

One look at the hundreds of books devoted to teams would reveal a bewildering list of characteristics that are allegedly critical to creating high performance. Obviously, every team and context is different and so it is impossible to specifically pinpoint any one ideal team success profile. However, recent research on teams has concluded that, across many different types of teams and contexts, five disciplines consistently emerge as essential to high performance: (1) small size, (2) capable and complementary members, (3) shared purpose and performance objectives, (4) productive norms and working approach, and (5) mutual accountability Other commonly identified disciplines (for example openness and communication) remain important, but none are as critical or as manageable as these five.
# 2

What stands out about this short list is that none of the five disciplines are provocative, novel, or difficult to understand. But isolating and understanding the essential disciplines have proved to be much easier than actually _applying_ those disciplines to achieve team performance. _Disciplines_ is absolutely the right word because it conveys the importance of consistent application as opposed to just knowing or identifying the characteristics.

Team expert Jon Katzenbach likes to make this point using an analogy from weight-loss efforts. That is, there are only a very few simple, widely known, and accepted behaviors for losing weight based on some essential principles (e.g., eat less, eat more wisely, exercise). However, if you do each of those three things only once, and then check them off your list, you will not lose weight. Only through repeated and disciplined application of all three can you expect to meet significant weight-loss goals. Similarly, it is only through the repeated and disciplined application of the team dimensions that your team will achieve high performance. Simply stated, the research suggests you really have to get high scores on all of the disciplines, and do so consistently, if you want to deliver team performance.
# 3

**Five Disciplines of High-Performing Teams**

_ **Small Size** _

It is seductive to believe that if two heads are better than one, maybe 15 heads would be better than five. That is, however, not the case. Just as one glass of wine a day is good for your heart but five probably isn&#39;t, there is a point of diminishing returns with respect to team size and performance. Research has shown that, on average, people working in smaller groups work harder, engage in a wider variety of tasks, assume more responsibility for the team&#39;s performance, and feel more involved with the team.
# 4
 The larger a team gets, the harder it is for people to meet either in person or virtually, gain shared understanding and commitment, share leadership roles, and so on.

&quot;_ **I believe in the &#39;two pizza&#39; group. If you can&#39;t feed the group with two pizzas, it is too large.&quot;** _

— **Jeff Bezos, CEO, Amazon**

We think Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos&#39;s &quot;two pizza group&quot; is an appropriate guideline.
# 5
 High-performing groups are rarely more than 10 people and ideally are between five and eight members. If you have some influence over team size, aim for the smallest number of people who would bring enough complementary skills to accomplish the objectives. Do not be seduced into thinking more is better, and if a natural grouping exceeds 10, break it into smaller subgroups.

_ **Capable and Complementary Members** _

People commonly believe they are good team players and have good team skills because they get along well with others or have always been well liked. However, as noted by former Atari CEO, David Pierce in the opening quote of this chapter, that perception is often inaccurate. The reality is that teamwork is _not_ for everyone, and some people are far better suited to making team contributions than others but their identity is often not obvious. A typical team selection trap is to neglect consideration of specific skills and instead opt for people who are either readily available or seem to have the right functional background.

Of course, every team needs enough functional or technical skills to complete their required tasks. If the team&#39;s job is house construction, then a group of chemists is unlikely to be optimal. However, it is not enough for team members to simply perform their functional area of expertise. The team also needs task management and interpersonal skills, and it is often much more elusive to determine whether potential members have those skills.

Other recent research has shown general cognitive ability and the personality characteristics of conscientiousness and agreeableness to be associated with higher team member ratings and performance outcomes.
# 6
 The implication of these findings for team performance is to not take for granted that people have the requisite skills to excel on a team. Look for ways to gather information about potential team members in order to make informed and systematic judgments about selection rather than rely solely on gut feel or demonstrated functional expertise or superficial personality judgments. In other words, most of the chapter 12 can help you select people who are likely to be strong team members and this is not an area where intuition or &quot;get feelings&quot; represent best practices.

In thinking about team composition, it is also important to recognize every successful team needs a mix of skills and talents to deliver its performance objectives. That is, the key is not necessarily to search for people who bring high levels of _all_ skills. Since people more often excel in limited areas, the focus should be on diversifying the team and considering multiple dimensions and potential interactions rather than solely evaluating members on their individual merits. As coaches Brooks and Rockne astutely noted in the nearby margin quotations, just having a group of individual stars is not the key to success. It is _complementary_ members, capable of playing roles and who together bring technical, problem-solving, and interpersonal skills that are the key to team success. A truly great example of this was seen when the Greek national basketball team beat a team of NBA all stars 101-95 in 2006. It is important to note that the Greek team did not have a single NBA player on its roster. &quot;We have to learn the international game better,&quot; U.S. coach Mike Krzyzewski said. &quot;We learned a lot today because we played a team that plays amazing basketball and plays together.&quot;

&quot;_ **We didn&#39;t have the twenty** _ **best** _ **guys. We had the twenty** _ **right** _ **guys.&quot;** _

— **Herb Brooks, Coach of 1980 &quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; U.S. Hockey Team**

Of course, many groups and managers do not have the opportunity to provide input on selecting their team members. But having the right skill sets in the team remains one of the disciplines of high performance—without that, no amount of process excellence will suffice. So it often makes sense to better understand the skill sets that exist in an assigned team and to consider strategies for filling gaps or reducing redundancies. There is also the possibility existing members might learn and grow into the skills the team ultimately needs.

_ **Shared Purpose and Performance Objectives** _

High-performing teams have both a clear understanding of the purpose of the team and a belief that the goal is worth pursuing. The best teams are also able to translate their purpose into a clear understanding of the outcome-based goals to be achieved. Indeed, there is growing consensus among team experts that the single most powerful engine for teams is a clear and compelling performance challenge. Without a clear performance imperative, little else matters. High-performing teams know explicitly what they are expected to accomplish and how they will be measured and evaluated as a team.
# 7

One of the more straightforward, but curiously neglected, prescriptions is to articulate _outcome_-based, rather than just _activity_-based, goals. This is a point similar to one discussed in our chapter on motivation. **Outcome-based goals** describe the specific outcomes by which success will be determined, while **activity-based goals** describe just the activities. Marriott Hotels, for example, use their Guest Service Index to assess performance of their hotel service employees. FedEx has a similar measure whereby employees evaluate their managers. Outcome-based goals answer the questions: How would we know success? or When would we declare victory? Unless a group comes to terms with their specific goals, the group&#39;s members are destined to struggle and unlikely to ultimately achieve high performance. To be blunt, if you cannot create shared performance objectives, _disband the team_.
# 8

Just as goals strengthen the motivation of individuals, they can also enhance the motivation in groups. For example, in a study of U.S. Air Force personnel, a group goal-setting and feedback program increased productivity by 75 percent.
# 9
 In a study of the Notre Dame University hockey team, specific goals for aggressive behavior led to a 141 percent increase in legal body checking over two years.
# 10
 Studies of United Way campaigns have found those communities that set challenging financial goals for their campaigns had better results than those with lower goals.
# 11
 Obviously, group goals can have significant effects.

**Productive Norms.**  **Norms** are generally unwritten rules or standards of behavior that apply to team members and can be either prescriptive—dictating what should be done—or proscriptive—dictating behaviors that should be avoided. Norms allow members to predict what others will do, help members gain a common sense of direction, and reinforce a team culture.
# 12
 Teams operate with many types of norms (communication, punctuality, level of formality), but among the most critical are those related to effort, meetings, and trust. Examples of productive and unproductive team norms are presented in Table 10.3.

Teams with norms that encourage preparedness and hard work on behalf of the team tend to be more successful in accomplishing their tasks. In a high-performing team, when someone violates a team norm, other members typically respond in ways that attempt to enforce the norm. These responses may include subtle suggestions, direct criticisms, reprimands, or even expulsion from the team. Strong norms create a team culture where members can rigorously, maybe even brutally, challenge each other without taking it personally or getting upset and defensive. Make no mistake, the difference between teams that achieve high performance and teams that don&#39;t is very often the productive norms that are established and enforced.

**Examples of Productive and Unproductive Team Norms**

![](RackMultipart20210506-4-2sxeqo_html_98406c7f12d91e97.jpg)

_ **Mutual Accountability** _

In high-performing teams, members pull their own weight, are rewarded for contributing, and challenged for slacking. Effective teams are characterized by high mutual trust among members and are concerned about the team&#39;s culture. High performance is rarely achieved if there is not a belief members can be trusted and will act in the best interests of others on the team. Effective teams find a way to reward those who contribute, and accountability is determined in part by the team reward structure.

There are two fundamentally different types of team rewards: cooperative and competitive.
# 13
**Cooperative team rewards** are distributed equally among team members. That is, the group is rewarded as a group for its successful performance, and each member receives exactly the same reward. This type of reward structure does not recognize individual differences in effort or performance. Cooperative reward systems ignore the possibility that some members make greater contributions to group task performance than others. This type of inequity can de-motivate team members who are high performers.

Under a **competitive team rewards** system, members are rewarded for successful performance as individuals on the team. They receive equitable rewards that vary according to their individual performance. It provides strong incentive for individual effort. It can also pit members against each other.

**Competitive team rewards** differentially reward team members based on their effort or performance. While competitive team rewards may please high performers, they may also undermine the team&#39;s cohesiveness.

Which of these two reward systems is most appropriate depends on the degree of task interdependence. Pairing cooperative rewards with low interdependence will encourage unnecessary cooperation, may stifle individual performance, and may also promote social loafing. A similar mismatch can occur when competitive rewards are coupled with high interdependence. In this case, members desiring to secure a payoff from their own efforts will detract from the collective spirit of the team.

In many team-based organizations, reward structures are constructed so that at least some portion of team members&#39; pay is contingent on the performance of the team as a whole.
# 14
 This promotes cooperation and reduces the incentive for competition among members. How rewards are allocated should also be based on how demonstrable (easily observed) the individual contributions are. In the case of a baseball player, for example, it is relatively easy to demonstrate individual performance. However, for a football player, performance is often heavily dependent on how other players performed; thus, cooperative rewards are more appropriate.

Because team performance is more difficult to track and the actions that people take and the results of the team are often blurry, the use of several sources of appraisal (such as peers and customers) makes particular sense with teams. Peer evaluations can allow members to get direct feedback about their performance and help a team enforce performance norms.

In short, the high-performing team challenge can be boiled down to: (1) keep the group small, (2) focus on complementary skill sets, (3) set clear outcome-based goals, (4) enforce productive norms and conflict management, and (5) match rewards to contributions, making at least some portion cooperatively based (see Table 10.4) .
# 15

It all sounds simple enough. However, we hasten to remind you the battle is maintaining the discipline to _execute_ those simple rules.

**Dysfunctions vs. Disciplines of a High-Performing Team**

The keys to effective teams are not particularly elusive or hard to know – but they have proven to be exceptionally hard _to do_. The table below aligns the most common and insidious team traps or dysfunctions
# 16
 with the team discipline and action strategy that can help teams be effective and enjoyable. If your team is working well, you&#39;re probably practicing all of these in some fashion. If your team is experiencing difficulty, check each step as a team, and you&#39;ll most likely figure out what needs to be worked on to bring about success.

**1. Teams get too big.** Keep to an optimal group size (3–10). &quot;If we have too many members, we&#39;ll assign subgroups and choose representatives to be a small coordinating team.&quot;

**2. Casual or convenient team assignments.** Obsess over team membership and aim **to e** nsure complementary skill sets. &quot;We have the technical (functional), problem-solving and interpersonal skills we need. Based on this work, no one is redundant; everyone has unique skills to contribute.&quot;

**3.**  **Inattention to results.** Establish a shared purpose and clear outcome. &quot;Here are _our_ goals and here are _my_ individual roles and outcome goals.&quot; &quot;We will measure our success by. . .&quot;

**4. Absence of commitment and trust.** Establish productive norms and working approach. &quot;We enforce norms regarding effort, meetings, and conflict management. We encourage spirited discussion and confrontation but with personal support. Our meetings are tight and disciplined.&quot;

**5. Unclear or diluted accountability.** Create mutual accountability. &quot;Here&#39;s what we&#39;re accountable for, why we have to do it together, and how we are each rewarded if we succeed.&quot;
